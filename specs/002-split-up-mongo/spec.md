# Feature Specification: Split up mongo.ts

**Feature Branch**: `002-split-up-mongo`  
**Created**: 27 de setembro de 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "split up mongo.ts. We need to thoroughly analyze its usage; cleanup unused paths; use DRY methodology. use Least Complex Solution Theorem The least complex solution is the solution where if you remove a component from it, it stops meeting the requirements. we need to split up the file with more reasonably split files, for easir maintainability, instead of having a single very large file"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Description provided: split mongo.ts file
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: analyze usage, cleanup unused code, apply DRY, use least complex solution, split into maintainable files
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No unclear aspects - requirements are clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User scenarios defined for refactoring task
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Requirements are testable and focused on maintainability
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí MongoDB collections and functions are the entities
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No uncertainties, no tech implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY (better maintainability, cleaner code)
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no specific file structures, just logical grouping)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a developer maintaining the ChatBB biodiversity application, I need the mongo.ts file to be split into logical, maintainable modules so that I can easily find, modify, and test database-related functionality without dealing with a single 1000+ line file.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a large mongo.ts file with mixed concerns, **When** I need to modify taxa-related functions, **Then** I can work in a dedicated taxa module without being distracted by occurrence or phenological code
2. **Given** database connection logic mixed with business logic, **When** I need to update connection settings, **Then** I can modify only the connection module without affecting business logic
3. **Given** functions with duplicated patterns, **When** I need to add a new kingdom-specific query, **Then** I can reuse existing DRY patterns without code duplication
4. **Given** unused code paths in the large file, **When** I analyze usage, **Then** unused functions are identified and can be safely removed

### Edge Cases

- What happens when splitting reveals circular dependencies between modules?
- How does the system handle imports when functions are moved to different files?
- What if some functions are used in multiple contexts and need to be in a shared module?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST split mongo.ts into logical modules based on functionality (connection, taxa, occurrences, threatened species, invasive species, phenological data, cache, utilities)
- **FR-002**: System MUST analyze all import statements across the codebase to ensure no functions become unreachable after splitting
- **FR-003**: System MUST identify and remove any unused functions or code paths during the analysis
- **FR-004**: System MUST apply DRY methodology by extracting common patterns (like kingdom-specific queries) into reusable utilities
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure each module follows the Least Complex Solution Theorem - removing any component breaks the module's specific requirements
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain all existing functionality while improving maintainability
- **FR-007**: System MUST update all import statements throughout the codebase to reference the new module structure

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **MongoDB Collections**: Core data entities (taxa, occurrences, faunaAmeacada, cncfloraPlantae, cncfloraFungi, invasoras, calFeno, occurrenceCache)
- **Connection Module**: MongoDB client management and connection utilities
- **Taxa Module**: Functions for querying and manipulating taxonomic data
- **Occurrences Module**: Functions for occurrence data and geographic queries
- **Threatened Species Module**: Functions for endangered/threatened species data
- **Invasive Species Module**: Functions for invasive species data
- **Phenological Module**: Functions for phenological calendar data
- **Cache Module**: Cache management for query results
- **Utilities Module**: Shared utilities like state normalization and filtering
